# ShardTierClassicItems

This mod adds the items from ClassicItemsReturns and/or StandaloneAncientScepter to the reward pools for traded shards, along with changing said items to be in shard item tier. Each item can be configured to be added to any amount of trades and/or have their item tier changed to the shards' tier. By default, all classic items are set to have their item tier changed and appear in all trades. Equipments aren't affected since there's no shard item tier for equipments.

If you're using this mod with ClassicItemsReturns, I recommend disabling the following items:
- 56 Leaf Clover
- The Hit List
- Snake Eyes
- Wicked ring (or enabling it's reworked effects)

<details>
<summary>Reason why <b>(SPOILERS)</b></summary>

Reason why is because Starstorm 2 already has items in the shard reward pool that have similar/the same effects as those ClassicItemsReturns items. Will they still be in the mod when the beta is finished? No clue. For now though, it's best to disable the duplicate items on ClassicItemsReturns' end.

I should also mention Rusty jetpack from ClassicItemsReturns: It doesn't have a similar item in the shard reward pool, but Starstorm 2's "Prototype Jet Boots" and "Uranium Horseshoe" items combined practically do what jetpack does.

## Known issues
- When getting a duplicate Ancient Scepter that's set to reroll into another item, it'll still reroll into a red item instead of another shard-tier item.
